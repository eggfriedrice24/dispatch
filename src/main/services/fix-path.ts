 * Fix `process.env.PATH` for macOS/Linux Electron apps.
 *
 * GUI apps on macOS inherit a minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`)
 * that doesn't include Homebrew, nvm, or other user-installed tool directories.
 * This resolves the user's login shell PATH and patches `process.env.PATH` so
 * that spawned child processes (e.g. `gh`, `git`) can be found.
 *
 * Must be called once, early in the main process — before any child spawning.
